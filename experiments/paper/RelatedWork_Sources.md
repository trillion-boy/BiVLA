# Related Work — provenance audit

*Every factual claim in `relatedwork.tex`, with how it was established. The
rule this session settled on: a claim about what a paper says needs that
paper's PDF, not its abstract.*

---

## Verified from the PDF

| # | claim in the draft | where verified |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | the Block Influence criterion we adopt is ShortGPT's | `RelatedWork.md` A.3, made against the PDF |
| 2 | EfficientVLA carries layer pruning into VLAs without training | A.1, from the PDF — *"이 셋을 학습 없이 동시에 줄이는 것이 목표"* |
| 3 | MoLe-VLA uses a learned router and distillation, so it is outside training-free | read this session: §3.5 *Optimization Objective*, Eq. 18–19, Gumbel-Softmax router, CogKD |
| 4 | VLA-Cache attributes poor transfer to short action sequences, and measures FastV leaving FLOPs unchanged while latency rises | A.2, from the PDF: 1.864 T unchanged, 51.91 → 53.28 ms |
| 5 | VLA-Pruner reproduces the degradation on a third setting | read this session: its Table 2, FastV retains 73.1% of baseline on SIMPLER at 75% |
| 6 | FLOWER prunes 30–50% of its VLM layers by design | read this session: *"we prune between 30% and 50% of the pretrained VLM's layers"* |
| 7 | SmolVLA retains only the first sixteen | read this session: *"We use only the first 16 layers of the LLM within the VLM"* |
| 8 | TurboVLA removes the language model from the action path | read this session: *"avoiding … processing multimodal inputs through a billion-parameter language model"*, chunks emitted *"without autoregressive action-token generation"* |
| 9 | vla-eval unifies fourteen benchmarks and documents previously undocumented pitfalls | read this session: 14 simulation benchmarks, six model servers, *"documenting previously undocumented pitfalls"* |
| 10 | papers using several backbones change the benchmark at the same time | VLA-Cache (A.2: LIBERO→OpenVLA, SIMPLER→CogACT); SpecPrune-VLA (Table 1: LIBERO→OpenVLA-OFT, SimplerEnv→DB-OFT); VLA-IAP (Table 1 caption: DreamVLA, π0 LIBERO, π0.5 VLABench) |
| 11 | those with both axes leave the crossing cell empty | Gaze-Reg (A.5); VLA-Pruner (LIBERO has OpenVLA + OpenVLA-OFT, SIMPLER has OpenVLA only) |
| 12 | all report mean success rates; none pairs episodes | grep over every PDF read: *paired* 0, *McNemar* 0, and in vla-eval also *significance* 0, *statistic* 0, *confidence* 0, *error bar* 0 |
| 13 | FastV, SparseVLM and ToMe were developed for VLMs | all three PDFs read this session |
| 14 | OpenVLA-OFT uses parallel decoding and action chunking | stated in the VLA-Pruner PDF describing its own baseline |

## Cited but **not** read — lineage only, no specific claim attached

These carry no number, quote or characterisation in the draft. They are cited
for provenance of an idea, which is the lowest-risk use, but they are unread
and that should not be forgotten before the bibliography is finalised.

| citation | what the draft asserts about it | risk |
|---|---|---|
| the two efficient-VLA surveys (arXiv 2510.17111, 2510.24795) | only that such surveys *"are now appearing"* | low — an existence claim |
| Gromov et al., *The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of the Deeper Layers* | grouped with ShortGPT as establishing layer redundancy | low, but it is a substantive grouping; read before submission |
| DQN (frame skip) | the origin of executing one decision over several steps | low — textbook lineage |
| ACT, Diffusion Policy | action chunking in imitation learning | low — textbook lineage |
| SimplerEnv, LIBERO | the benchmarks results are reported on | none — we run them |

**Deliberately not cited:** StarVLA. Its stated problem — inconsistent
preprocessing and evaluation protocols across VLA papers — supports our
motivation and would be worth citing, but we have only a search snippet, not
the PDF. It is left out rather than paraphrased from a snippet.

**Deliberately not cited:** the ten training-free papers in
`Survey_2026-08.md` §4. Abstract-level only. The MoLe-VLA lesson applies.

## Two claims worth re-checking before submission

1. **"none pairs episodes."** This is a negative claim over the papers we
   read, not over the field. The draft states it as a property of the tables
   we cite, which is what we can defend. If it is ever widened to "no prior
   work does this," it needs the systematic sweep again.

2. **The crossing-cell claim.** Verified across five papers, but it is the
   sentence a reviewer is most likely to test, and the field is moving fast —
   `Survey_2026-08.md` exists because this claim was already too strong once.
   Re-run the sweep close to submission.

## What is deliberately absent from the section

- **No table.** *Bag of Tricks* puts its configuration table in the
  Introduction, before Related Work; ours goes in the same place
  (`Table~\ref{tab:reporting}`), and Related Work only points at it.
- **The per-task split (§2.5 of `RelatedWork.md`)** appears as one clause, not
  a paragraph. It is a finding, and findings belong in Results and in the
  Introduction, not in background.
- **Our own numbers.** Related Work makes no measurement claim of ours except
  the forward pointer in the closing sentence.
